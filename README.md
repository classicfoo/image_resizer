# image_resizer

This Python program allows you to resize and compress images to a smaller file size. The program takes an input image, resizes it to 200x200 pixels, and compresses it to reduce its file size. The output image is saved in the same directory as the original image, with "-min" appended to the filename.

Features:
Resize: Images are resized to a fixed size of 200x200 pixels.
Compression: Images are compressed to reduce file size while maintaining visual quality.
Input and Output: Input images can be in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format. Output images are saved with "-min" appended to the original filename.
Ease of Use: Simply run the program in the directory containing the images you want to resize and compress.
How to Use:
Install Python if you haven't already.
Install the Pillow library using pip install Pillow.
Save the provided Python script in the directory containing your images.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
Run the script using python image_resizer.pyw.
The resized and compressed images will be saved in the same directory with "-min" appended to their filenames.
Example:
Suppose you have an image named example.jpg in your directory. Running the script will resize and compress the image, saving the result as example-min.jpg.

Note:
This program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL), now known as Pillow, for image processing.
